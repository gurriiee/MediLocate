## Introduction
Imagine a world where booking a medical appointment is as easy as ordering your favorite meal online—no more endless phone calls, no more waiting for days just to get a simple appointment. **MediLocate** brings this vision to life by developing a web-based application designed to revolutionize how Canadians book medical appointments.

Our platform supports two types of logins:
1. Patients for scheduling appointments.
2. Medical staff for managing schedules and clinic information.

**Key Features:**
- Browse clinics by location (Regina, Moose Jaw, and Saskatoon).
- Easy appointment booking with a simple interface.
- Dual login functionality for patients and medical staff.

## Design Problem

### Problem Definition
[View Business Case](https://github.com/ansarahmed789/ENSE-374-Project/blob/main/Business%20Case.pdf)

Accessing healthcare in Canada is challenging due to long wait times and difficulty securing appointments. This issue impacts patient outcomes and contributes to inefficiencies in healthcare management.

## Solution

### Solution 1
Our initial idea focused on a flexible schedule management system for clinics. However, it lacked key features like automated reminders and EHR integration, which are essential for modern healthcare platforms.

### Solution 2
The second solution involved integrating Google Maps API for visualizing clinic locations. While innovative, it introduced complexities in real-time data management and accessibility features.

### Final Solution
Our final solution categorizes clinics by cities, making it easier for users to browse clinics in Regina, Moose Jaw, and Saskatoon. This approach prioritizes simplicity, accessibility, and scalability.

## Conclusion and Future Work
Our project successfully delivered a streamlined platform for clinic management and appointment booking. While the solution met its primary goals, limitations such as geographic scope and real-time data updates remain.  
**Recommendations for Future Work:**
- Expand geographic coverage.  
- Add real-time data synchronization.  
- Incorporate accessibility features like text-to-speech.
